Garden helper app
This is an app that helps users know more about their plants and
help them get the right environment for their plants.

There is a daily weather forecast for the next 5 days at the top
of the main activity that is updated based on user's location using
the gps.

If user does not provide location then there won't be any weather information.

Under it users can look up a plant they want to know more about and click search.
Users can then select the plant and it will be stored locally.

In the overflow menu of the App toolbar, there are 3 options that
users can select for getting air humidity, pressure, and temperature.

When clicked it will get the current data from the sensors of the phone.
It will also show you the locally stored plant's recommended environment 
as well to help users know if their plant is in a suitable environment.

App is locked vertically.

APIs used
